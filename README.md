Space Invaders with LWJGL
======
###### Note: this project is still under construction, and has a long way to go
Using the Lightweight Java Game Library, I am making my own space invaders game. This is purely for fun/educational purposes.

# Built with
- [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) - Development environment for Java
- [LWJGL 3](https://www.lwjgl.org/) - Java library providing access to resources such as GLFW, OpenGL, OpenAL, and more

# Acknowledgements
- [Prof. White](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~wmwhite/) for providing inspiration
